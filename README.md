# 📊 Data Cleaning and Sales Analysis in Spreadsheets (Q4 2024)

## 📌 Business Context
VentaExpress is a growing e-commerce company that sells technology products — laptops, phones, tablets, and accessories — across multiple cities in **Mexico and Colombia**.

As a **junior data analyst**, I was tasked with analyzing **raw Q4 2024 sales data (October–December)** to support the creation of an **executive-level report**. The dataset was unstructured and contained common real-world data issues that required cleaning, validation, and transformation before analysis.
